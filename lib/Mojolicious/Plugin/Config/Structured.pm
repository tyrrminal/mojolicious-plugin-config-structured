=encoding UTF-8

=head1 NAME

Mojolicious::Plugin::Config::Structured - provides Mojo app access to structured configuration data

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  # For a full Mojo app
  $self->plugin('Config::Structured' => {config_file => $filename});

  ...

  if ($c->conf->feature->enabled) {
    ...
  }

  say $c->conf->email->recipient->{some_feature};

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Mojolicious Plugin for L<Config::Structured>: locates and reads config and definition files and loads them into a 
Config::Structured instance, made available globally via the C<conf> method.

=cut

use Config::Structured;
use Readonly;

use experimental qw(signatures);

Readonly::Scalar our $PERIOD => q{.};

Readonly::Scalar our $DEF_FILE_SUFFIX  => q{def};

=head1 METHODS

L<Mojolicious::Plugin::Config::Structured> inherits all methods from L<Mojolicious::Plugin> and implements the following
new ones

=head2 register

    $plugin->register(Mojolicious->new, [structure_file => $struct_fn,] [config_file => $config_file])

Register plugin in L<Mojolicious> application. C<structure_file> is the filesystem path of the file that defines the 
configuration definition. If omitted, a sane default is used (C<./{app}.conf.def>) relative to the mojo app home.

C<config_file> is the filesystem path of the file that provides the active configuration. If omitted, a sane default is
used (C<./{app}.{mode}.conf> or C<./{app}.conf>)

  }

    structure => $def_file,

  )->__register_default;

=head2 conf

This method is used to access the loaded configuration from within the Mojo 
application. Returns the root L<Config::Structured> instance.
